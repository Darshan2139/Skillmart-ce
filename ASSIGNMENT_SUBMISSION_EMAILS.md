# Assignment Submission Email Notifications

## Overview
This feature adds email notifications when students submit assignments, providing confirmation and details about their submission including any attached files.

## Features Added

### 1. Assignment Submission Confirmation Email
- **Trigger**: Automatically sent when a student submits an assignment or quiz
- **Recipient**: The student who submitted the assignment
- **Content**: 
  - Submission confirmation message
  - Assignment details (title, course, section)
  - Submission timestamp and attempt number
  - Submitted text content (if any)
  - List of attached files with download links
  - Score information (for quizzes)
  - Attempt status (current attempt out of 3)

### 2. Email Template
- **File**: `server/mail/templates/assignmentSubmissionConfirmation.js`
- **Design**: Modern, responsive HTML email template
- **Features**:
  - Dark theme matching SkillMart branding
  - Clear submission details
  - File attachment display with icons
  - Responsive design for mobile devices
  - Professional styling with gradients and shadows

### 3. Email Service Integration
- **File**: `server/services/emailNotificationService.js`
- **Method**: `sendAssignmentSubmissionConfirmation(submissionId)`
- **Features**:
  - Populates submission data with assignment and student details
  - Handles errors gracefully (doesn't fail submission if email fails)
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. API Integration
- **File**: `server/controllers/Assignment.js`
- **Location**: `submitAssignment` function
- **Integration**: Email sent immediately after successful submission creation
- **Error Handling**: Email failures don't affect submission success

## How It Works

1. **Student submits assignment** through the frontend
2. **Backend processes submission** and saves to database
3. **Email notification service** is triggered with submission ID
4. **Email template** generates HTML content with submission details
5. **Email is sent** to student's registered email address
6. **Student receives confirmation** with all submission details

## Email Content

The confirmation email includes:

- ✅ Success confirmation message
- 📝 Assignment details (title, course, section, due date)
- 📊 Submission info (timestamp, attempt number, score if applicable)
- 📄 Submitted text content (formatted and scrollable)
- 📎 Attached files list with download links
- 🔢 Attempt status and remaining attempts
- 🔗 Link to view all assignments

## File Attachments

- **Supported formats**: PDF and TXT files
- **Display**: Each attachment shows with appropriate icon (📄 for PDF, 📝 for TXT)
- **Links**: Direct download links to Supabase storage
- **Validation**: Only valid file types are processed and displayed

## Error Handling

- **Email failures** don't prevent successful submission
- **Missing data** is handled gracefully with fallback values
- **Template errors** are logged but don't crash the system
- **Network issues** are handled with retry logic in the email service

## Testing

To test the email notifications:

1. **Start the server**: `npm start` in the server directory
2. **Submit an assignment** through the frontend
3. **Check email** for confirmation message
4. **Verify content** includes all submission details and attachments

## Configuration

The email system uses the existing mail configuration:
- **SMTP settings** in `server/utils/mailSender.js`
- **Frontend URL** from environment variables
- **Email templates** in `server/mail/templates/`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- Email preferences for students
- Instructor notifications when assignments are submitted
- Bulk submission confirmations
- Email templates for different assignment types
- Attachment preview in emails
- Submission status tracking

## Files Modified

1. `server/mail/templates/assignmentSubmissionConfirmation.js` - New email template
2. `server/services/emailNotificationService.js` - Added submission confirmation method
3. `server/controllers/Assignment.js` - Integrated email sending in submission flow

## Dependencies

- Existing email system (`mailSender.js`)
- Assignment models (`Assignment.js`, `AssignmentSubmission.js`)
- User and Course models for data population
- Supabase for file storage and public URLs
